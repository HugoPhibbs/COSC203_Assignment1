### Resolved issues

- Initially, I tried to host the necessary json data files on my Google Drive, this proved difficult - so I just
  resorted to hosting the files via my GitHub. I could then get these files by fetching from the public pages view of my
  repository.
- I had a bit of trouble with the search feature, especially to do with the functions filter() and sort()
- The information cards for birds involved quite a bit of tweaking to get them just right, i.e. correcting inner element
  sizes, so they all fit well together.
- Getting the responsive design to not ruin any of my formatting was a bit of a challenge
- Had to look to online forums in order to get normalization of Maori strings correctly, I used the solution
  found [here](https://javascriptf1.com/snippet/remove-accents-from-a-string-in-javascript).

### Enhancements and extra features

- A user can enter the minimum and max weight/length of birds they would like to view via the search form
- A simple colour guide is shown of all the different conservation statuses. This is a desktop only feature, I couldn't
  find a neat way to fit this for small screens.
- User's can sort by weight and size of birds (I'm not sure if this counts as an extra feature or not!)
  - Added a hover feature for bird information cards. 

### Open challenges

- There is an issue of overflowing text for very small screens (width < 300px), however I figure that if people are
  using small devices,
  they are likely on the larger side (eg current iPhone and Samsung models, not first generation ones). The smallest
  phone that I think anyone could reasonably use in 2022 is the iPhone 7, which my website is fine with.

### Third Party Libraries used

- I didn't use any third party libraries for this project
