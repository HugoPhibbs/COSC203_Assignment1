### Links

- Website: [somewhere](google.com)
- Repository: [somewhere](google.com)

### Resolved issues

- Initially, I tried to host the necessary json data files on my Google Drive, this proved difficult - so I just
  resorted to hosting the files via my GitHub. I could then get these files by fetching from the public pages view of my
  repository.
- I had a bit of trouble with the search feature, especially to do with the functions filter() and sort()
- The information cards for birds involved quite a bit of tweaking to get them just right, i.e. correcting inner element
  sizes so they all fit well together

### Third Party Libraries used

- TODO

### Enhancements and extra features

- A user can enter the minimum and max weight/length of birds they would like to view via the search form. I tried to
  insert a double range slider, however this requires JQuery, which is beyond my scope.
